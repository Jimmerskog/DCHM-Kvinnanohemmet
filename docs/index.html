                     <h2>Welcome!</h2>
                     <p>Here you can see the result of a digitisation project carried out on the September
                        issue of Kvinnan och Hemmet from 1930. The original title was Kvinden og Hjemmet and
                        was published in Norwegian and Danish between 1888-1947. From 1893 the magazine was
                        also released in Swedish. Kvinnan och Hemmet was a monthly magazine intended for Scandinavian
                        women who had moved to the United States and the goal was to help Scandinavian women
                        transition to the American way of life. The editor, Ida Hansen, had first hand experience
                        as an immigrant to the United States from Norway.</p>
                     <p>The journal was distributed all around the country as well as in Canada and the Scandinavian
                        countries. It was the biggest Scandinavian women’s journal in the United States at
                        the time and could print as many as 80 000 copies of an issue. Kvinden og Hjemmet
                        brought up topics such as women’s right to vote, family, politics, child rearing and
                        usually concluded recipes, short stories, serials, poems, handicraft and also supplements
                        such as Vårt bibliotek (“Our library”) and Mönster tidning (“Pattern paper”).</p>
                     <p> 
                         This digital reproduction of Kvinnan och Hemmet was carried out as a final project
                        whithin the course Digitizing cultural heritage at the University of Borås. The repository
                        for this project can be found at GitHub: https://github.com/Jimmerskog/DCHM-Kvinnanohemmet</p>
