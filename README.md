# Kvinnan och hemmet - a digtisation of a women's journal from 1930
This is a digtisation of an older women's journal, Kvinnan och Hemmet. It's the September issue of Kvinnan och Hemmet from 1930. The original title was Kvinden og Hjemmet and was published in Norwegian and Danish between 1888-1947. From 1893 the magazine was also released in Swedish. Kvinnan och Hemmet was a monthly magazine intended for Scandinavian women who had moved to the United States and the goal was to help Scandinavian women transition to the American way of life. The editor, Ida Hansen, had first hand experience as an immigrant to the United States from Norway.

The journal was distributed all around the US and was the biggest Scandinavian women’s journal in the US at the time. Kvinden og Hjemmet brought up topics such as women’s right to vote, family, politics, child rearing and usually concluded recipes, short stories, serials, poems, handicraft and also supplements such as Vårt bibliotek (“Our library”) and Mönster tidning (“Pattern paper”).

The repository conclude images with embeded metadata of each page of the journal, an xml-file with the text encoding of the content of the journal, xslt-files for the conversion to html-files and html-files for each page of the website. My goal with this project has been to make the material accesible and useble for future users. The material is therfore under Creative commons license (CC BY-NC 4.0) and is free to reuse.
